# Some information about each homework.

- Homework0: A basic, brute-force program in order to find the longest, duplicate substring in a given string.
- Homework2: Utilizing the graphics in the stdlib.jar library, we create different methods for generating shapes or patterns. It is controlled through command line arguments in the terminal.
- Homework3: Again with the help of the stdlib.jar, we create our first object, Robot. By placing many Robots in a 2-dimensional grid, we can see them going through different paths and either escaping or crashing with each other. They move randomly.
