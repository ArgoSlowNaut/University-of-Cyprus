* Compilation command: javac LongestDupSubstring.java
* Execution command: java LongestDupSubstring
* 
* This program is designed to find the longest duplicate substring in a given string.
* It works by brute forcing through all possible substrings of our input string.
* We have a nested for loop.
* In the header for loop, the counter i defines the length of the possible substrings we want to construct
* then, we go through all possible positions (starting from 0 to input.length()-i)
* and the third for loop is responsible for constructing another String object, which equals the String from each position k to k+i
* 
* Then we have a double nested for loop within the triple nested for loop for constructing all other possible substrings with the same length
* 
* variables places, placee and placesa, placeeb stand for each substring's ranges respectively, to make sure they do not overlap
* as per the exercise's rules
* 
* then we see if those substrings are equal, to see if it is a duplicate
*at the same time, we check if the length of this  duplicate string is larger than our current larger length
* 
*if we do find a larger duplicate string, we replace the ans object with that string where we store the answer 
*
*this solution always finds the first largest duplicate substring, since if there is a duplicate substring of equal length
*then it will not be replaced
